# Phish-Data
This is practice for me to get better at creating my own datasets from the web and using them for machine learning practice. The goal of this project is to use ML to predict if any given Phish concert will be rated above or below average by the online community of my fellow Phish fans. The predictor variables are seemingly extraneuous to the quality of the show. Namely, the actual songs played by the band are NOT included as predictors. Instead, variables such as the day of the week, total number of songs played, the venue etc. are used. The point of this being to gain insight into what ingredients lead to a Phish show being rated high or low by its fans. It is a work in progress.
